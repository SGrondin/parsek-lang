These are the sources of the Kernel/CORE interpreter as described here:

      http://fraczak.dyndns.org/KernelCORE/

written in Ocaml. To compile you will need "ocaml" and "make"
installed. Do:

   > make 

It will create two executable files:

 1. k-native    -- smaller faster

 2. k-bytecode  -- slower but with debug infos 

To test the program do:

   > echo "main = {};" | ./k-native

It should print:

   --- EVALUATION (by interpretation) of main(): 
   {}

To run an example from the "Examples" directory, eg., "bool.k", do:

   > cd ./Examples

first, and then:

   > ../k-native < bool.k

since some examples are using other files and it is assumend that they
are located in the working directory.
