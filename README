Kernel Language is a simple first order functional programming
language. The main characteristics of Kernel language are:

1. The language is embeddable (extensible) via concepts of Environment Monoid;

2. An efficient (and in some sense optimal) compilation for the language exists;

3. Programs written in Kernel Language are predictable (formal
   reasoning about Kernel programs is possible due to the mathematical
   semantics of the language).


A programming language can be used for describtion of a pure
mathematical function as well as for description of an interactive
system (coffee machine). Often, the behavioral and the functional
aspects of programming are considered as incompatible. 

LINKING:

Two compiled Kernel programs can be linked together however this is
like composing pipes in UNIX; the resulting system (may be
distributed) is interpreted. On the other hand two Kernel programs put
together within compilation process will produce highly optimised one
executable program.
