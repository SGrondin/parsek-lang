Compilation and linking are parametrized by "environment". Environment
is seen as "target architecture". In the first version of Kernel
Language we only provide "FIFO environment" which defines binary input
output channels (unbounded and bounded size FIFOs). 

It is important to develop other generic "environments", such as "hash
tables", "priority queues", etc. Also, it would be nice to develop a
particular "environment" for a commercially available piece of
hardware.
